# Exercise 4
Why do you think different layers have different importances?

# Answer
In the ResNet frame of thinking later residuals represent less error than earlier residuals.  
However, this trend (removing earlier layers does more damage than removing later layers) should occur other architectures as well as the later layers build off of the features represented in the earlier ones.
